## 🧠 About Me

I'm **KZ**, a results-driven **AI Tech Lead** and **Generative AI Developer** focused on delivering intelligent, scalable, and business-aligned AI solutions. With 4.5+ years of deep tech experience, I build:

- 🔹 End-to-end **LLM applications** with production-grade architecture
- 🔹 **AI scraping systems** using GPT + Selenium + Scrapy
- 🔹 High-performing **PDF agents**, chatbots, and RAG pipelines
- 🔹 Custom **SaaS platforms** with smart automation baked in

I lead cross-functional teams, own delivery pipelines, and bring a laser focus on **velocity + quality**. Not here for theory—here to build.

## 🔥 Current Focus

> Here's what I'm cooking right now — from AI pipelines to production deployments:

### ⚙️ GenAI Products & Pipelines
- 🧾 **PDF Agent** using LLaMA 3 + Groq with persistent vector indexing and contextual chat history  
- 📂 **Multi-Document Query App** with optimized RAG, Elasticsearch, and dynamic prompt engineering  
- 🔄 **A2A (Agent-to-Agent Communication)**: Coordinating autonomous agents for multi-step tasks  
- 🧠 **MCP (Multi-Component Pipeline)**: Architecting reusable modules for embeddings, retrieval, reasoning, and generation  

### 💬 Conversational AI
- 🗂️ Continuous session-based **policy chatbots** with session memory and source document tracking  
- 💬 AI-powered **customer support systems** with feedback loops and relevance boosting  
- 🎯 Query understanding using GPT for smart routing (graph generation, lead filtering, etc.)  

### 🕸️ Scraping & Data Intelligence
- ⚡ Real-time AI scraping engines using **Scrapy + GPT** for classification & transformation  
- 🌐 Auto-login scraping with **Selenium/Playwright** and storage to PostgreSQL + AWS S3  
- 🧹 Smart document cleaning, tagging, and indexing pipeline  

### 📊 Dashboards & Analytics
- 📉 Custom lead analytics dashboards (Streamlit) with NLP-powered filters and graph insights  
- 🔍 AI-powered **search and trend analysis** dashboards using vector databases  
- 📊 Role-based insights: Sales team breakdowns, stage-wise lead trends, conversion predictors  

### ⚡ SaaS / Web App Infra
